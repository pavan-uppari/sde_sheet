## 2 Sum
**❓**: Check if a pair with given sum exists in Array<br>
**🧠**:<br>
1. Store the current element with index in hash map<br>
2. while iterating through arrays, check whether curr - sum in hashmap<br>


```py
{!04_arrays_part4/1_2sum.py!}
```

## 4 Sum
**❓**: Find Quads that add up to a target value<br>
**🧠**:<br>
1. Sort the array and use 4 pointers.<br>
2. Fix i and j pointers and put left and right pointers at the left and right end of remaining array<br>
3. **To avoid duplicate quads, while moving the pointers, move them only if they are not equal to their previous elements**<br>
4. If 4 elements sum is equal to target, store them. Else according to sum, move left and right pointers as elements are already sorted


```py
{!04_arrays_part4/2_4sum.py!lines=1-28}
```

(Another approach to avoid duplicates is storing them in set)
```py
{!04_arrays_part4/2_4sum.py!lines=30-48}
```

## Longest Consecutive Sequence
**❓**: You are given an array of ‘N’ integers. You need to find the length of the longest sequence which contains the consecutive elements.<br>
**🧠**:<br>
O(NlogN) Solution<br>
1. Sort the array<br>
2. Find the consecutive sequence by iterating through array. (it cannot have same elements)<br>

O(N) Solution<br>
1. Store all the elements in set<br>
2. For every element, search and count all the consecutive elements only if<br>
    a. It is start of sequence(curr-1 is not in set)<br>
    b. We will storing maximum sequence in a variable res. if curr + res is not present in set, that means the curr count itself is large sequence, again don't need to find the current sequence length

## Longest SubArray with Zero Sum
**❓**: Given an array containing both positive and negative integers, we have to find the length of the longest subarray with the sum of all elements equal to zero.<br>
**🧠**:<br>
1. Store the prefix sum in hashmap with value as index<br>
2. if we find the prefix sum again, then that part of array sum is zero<br>


```py
{!04_arrays_part4/4_longest_subarray_with_sum_zero.py!}

## Longest Substring without repeating characters 
**❓**: Given a String, find the length of longest substring without any repeating character.<br>
**🧠**:<br>
1. Store the seen elements in hashmap with its indexes<br>
2. Once you encounter a seen element, compute the res by finding the gap b/w current index and seen index and reset left pointer to seen index plus 1<br>
