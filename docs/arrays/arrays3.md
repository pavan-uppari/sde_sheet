## Search in 2d Matrix

**❓**: Search in a sorted 2D matrix<br>

**Approach 1**:<br>
Simple Maths Equations<br>
1. Iterate through each row and check whether target can exist in that row or not<br>
2. If yes, do a binary search<br>
3. From those 2 equations, X and Y can be found out<br>

Time Complexity -> O(n + logm)

## Pow(x,n)

**❓**: Given a double x and integer n, calculate x raised to power n. Basically Implement pow(x, n).<br>

**🧠**<br>
```
6 ** 5

ans = 6
6 ** 4

(6 * 6) ** 2
36 ** 2
(36**36) ** 1
ans = ans * 36*36

1. If power if odd, multiply the curr number to ans and reduce curr number by 1
2. If power if even, square the curr number and reduce the power by half
```

SC - O(1)

## Majority Element (>n/2 times)

**❓**: Given an array of N integers, write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array. You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.<br>

## Majority Element (>n/3 times)

**❓**: Given an array of N integers. Find the elements that appear more than N/3 times in the array. If no such element exists, return an empty vector.<br>



**🧠**:<br>
Same as previous majority element algo. The difference is we apply the same algo for 2 elements and at the end we will find out which occurs more than n/3 times manually again.<br>

## Grid Unique Paths

**❓**: Given a matrix m X n, count paths from left-top to the right bottom of a matrix with the constraints that from each cell you can either only move to the rightward direction or the downward direction.<br>
